# Islands

> Source: https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/concepts/islands

## TL;DR
An island is an interactive Preact component that hydrates client-side. Place it in `islands/` (root) or any `(_islands)/` folder inside `routes/`. Use PascalCase or kebab-case filenames. Props must be serializable; functions cannot be passed.

## Defining an island
```tsx
// islands/Counter.tsx
import { useSignal } from "@preact/signals";

export default function Counter() {
  const count = useSignal(0);
  return <button onClick={() => count.value++}>{count}</button>;
}
```
Use it from any route or component:
```tsx
import Counter from "../islands/Counter.tsx";
export default () => <main><Counter /></main>;
```

## Co-located islands
Place islands next to the routes that use them via `(_islands)`:
```
routes/
  dashboard/
    index.tsx
    (_islands)/
      Chart.tsx
```

## Serializable prop types
- Primitives: string, number, boolean, bigint, null, undefined
- Special numbers: `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, `-0`, `NaN`
- `Date`, `RegExp`, `URL`, `Uint8Array`
- `Map`, `Set`, `Temporal.*`
- Plain objects + arrays of the above
- Preact **Signals**
- **JSX elements** (server-rendered chunks can be passed as children/props)
- Circular references are preserved

## NOT supported
- Functions (event handlers must live inside the island)
- Class instances (other than the explicitly-supported types)

## Nesting
Islands can render other islands. JSX passed as `children` from a server component is rendered server-side and embedded as static HTML inside the island.

## Gotchas
- File must be a default export.
- Importing an island from a non-route file is fine; what matters is that it lives under an islands directory.
- If you accidentally pass a function prop, the build/runtime will error — move the handler inside the island.
